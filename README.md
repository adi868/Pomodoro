# Pomodoro Timer Application

The Pomodoro Timer Application is a productivity tool designed to help individuals manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. It allows users to break their work into focused intervals, known as "pomodoros," followed by short breaks to maintain concentration and productivity.

## Features

1. **Pomodoro Timer**: The application provides a timer that allows users to set the duration for their work sessions, typically referred to as "pomodoros." Users can customize the length of their work sessions to suit their preferences and work style.

2. **Break Timer**: After each completed pomodoro, the application automatically initiates a short break. Users can customize the duration of their breaks to relax, refresh, and rejuvenate before the next work session.

3. **Notifications**: The application sends notifications to alert users when a work session ends. These notifications ensure that users stay on track and can switch between work and break sessions seamlessly.

4. **Progress Tracking**: The application tracks and displays the user's progress, showing the number of completed pomodoros. This feature helps users monitor their productivity over time and assess their performance.

5. **Customizable Settings**: Users have the flexibility to customize various settings based on their preferences. They can adjust the duration of work sessions, breaks, the volume of the notifications, and the number of pomodoros.
