# Pomodoro Timer Application

The Pomodoro Timer Application is a productivity tool designed to help individuals manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It allows users to break their work into focused intervals, known as "pomodoros," followed by short breaks to maintain concentration and productivity.

## Features

1. **Pomodoro Timer**: The application provides a timer that allows users to set the duration for their work sessions, typically referred to as "pomodoros." Users can customize the length of their work sessions to suit their preferences and work style.

2. **Break Timer**: After each completed pomodoro, the application automatically initiates a short break. Users can customize the duration of their breaks to relax, refresh, and rejuvenate before the next work session. On every 4th round, a longer, 20-minute break session is activated.

3. **Notifications**: The application notifies users when a work session or break session ends. These notifications ensure that users stay on track and can switch between work and break sessions seamlessly.

4. **Progress Tracking**: The application tracks and displays the user's progress, showing the number of completed pomodoros. This feature helps users monitor their productivity over time and assess their performance. 4 pomodoros (rounds) form a set. The application will track the number of sets completed as well and display the progress.

5. **Customizable Settings**: Users have the flexibility to customize various settings based on their preferences. They can adjust the duration of work sessions, breaks, the volume of the notifications, and the number of pomodoros. 

## Getting Started

To use the Pomodoro Timer Application, follow these steps:

1. **Set Pomodoro Duration**: Adjust the duration of your work sessions (pomodoros) according to your preference. The default duration is 25 minutes.

2. **Set Break Duration**: Customize the duration of your breaks. The default duration is 5 minutes.

3. **Start the Timer**: Begin the pomodoro timer to initiate your work session. The application will automatically switch to break mode once the pomodoro is completed. The timer will end after you have completed the defined number of rounds.
